voncount: A gcc plugin to report statistics about the code being compiled.
==========================================================================

What
----
voncount is a GCC plugin which merely prints statistics about the files being
compiled.  Most notably is that this tool prints the line counts and functions
that GCC processed.


Build
-----
This is a gcc plugin and uses the plugin framework built with g++ in version 4.7
of gcc.  To build things simply run `make' from the voncount directory.


Use
---
Next time you build with gcc 4.7 or higher, include the plugin by passing the
'-fplugin=voncount.so' flag to gcc.  gcc must know where voncount.so is located,
if not, you can specify the full path:
    `gcc foo.c -fplugin=/path/to/voncount.so'


Name
----
Von Count? WTF?  That's right! This tool, as it counts source lines of code,
celebrates the name of the best counter the world has ever known.  This number
friendly gentleman resides just outside of  Sesame Street: Count Von Count.
